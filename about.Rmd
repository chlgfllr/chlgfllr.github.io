title: "About me"
---

I'm a 2nd year PhD student in linguistics at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling).

I am interested in phonetics and psycholinguistics. My current research focuses on the processing of rhythmic irregularities in English, to determine to what extent listeners have metrical expectations during speech perception. 

Before doing linguistics, I was training to be a professional ballet and contemporary dancer. I've also trained in music, and played the violin for a really long time. I am interested in the parallels that can be drawn between speech, dance and music, and it should be no surprise that the aspects of language that I work mostly on are articulation (for instance, movements of the tongue in the vocal tract) and speech perception!

I'm originally from France, and completed my MA at [Universit√© Paris-Diderot](https://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) before moving to Los Angeles. In my free time, I enjoy doing yoga and taking strolls in Griffith Park!
